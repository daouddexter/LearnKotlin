/*Important concepts:

Function types, allowing functions to receive other functions as parameters or return other functions
Lambda expressions, letting you pass around blocks of code with minimum boilerplate
Data classes, providing a concise syntax for creating immutable value objects
A rich set of APIs in the standard library for working with objects and collections in the functional style

Kotlin is statically typed and supports type inference, allowing it to maintain correctness and
performance while keeping the source code concise.

Kotlin supports both object-oriented and functional programming styles, enabling higher-level
abstractions through first-class functions and simplifying testing and multithreaded development
through the support of immutable values.

It works well for server-side applications, fully supporting all existing Java frameworks and
providing new tools for common tasks such as HTML generation and persistence.

It works for Android as well, thanks to a compact runtime, special compiler support for
Android APIs, and a rich library providing Kotlin-friendly functions for common Android development
 tasks.

Itâ€™s free and open source, with full support for the major IDEs and build systems.

Kotlin is pragmatic, safe, concise, and interoperable, meaning it focuses on using proven solutions
for common tasks, preventing common errors such as NullPointerExceptions, supporting compact and
easy-to-read code, and providing unrestricted integration with Java.
